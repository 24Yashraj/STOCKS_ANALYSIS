Integrated a stock price dataset into Jupyter Notebook for detailed analysis and manipulation using Python's pandas library.
Calculated moving averages at 50% and 200% intervals, and extracted relevant metrics like the previous day's price, closing day price, and previous day's volume. 
This foundational work aimed to uncover trends and patterns in stock price movements.


Exported the cleaned and analyzed data to CSV format, then imported it into Tableau Public for advanced visualization.
Utilized Tableau's capabilities, including calculated fields, parameters, and filters, to create comprehensive and interactive dashboards. 
These visualizations allowed for clear and insightful representation of stock price trends and metrics, making it easier to identify significant movements and patterns.

The project successfully highlighted key trends in stock prices, particularly through the use of moving averages and detailed visual analysis.
The implementation of date range filters in Tableau enabled precise identification of recent declines in stock prices, providing valuable insights for stakeholders. 
This project underscores the importance of combining robust data analysis with effective visualization tools to drive informed decision-making in financial contexts.
